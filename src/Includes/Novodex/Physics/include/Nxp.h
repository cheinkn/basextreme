	we should render a line of length 1. Depending on your objects/scene, this might be completely invisible
	or extremely huge. That's why the scale factor is here, to let you tune the length until it's ok in
	your scene.
	- however, things like collision shapes aren't ambiguous. They are clearly defined for example by the
	triangles & polygons themselves, and there's no point in scaling that. So the visualization widgets
